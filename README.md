# Python module 07: DataDeck

A Python project designed for students of School 42.
This module introduces advanced architectural patterns through a modular card game engine simulation, following the official DataDeck subject.

This project is an introduction to abstract base classes (ABC), multiple inheritance, interface composition, and design patterns like Factory and Strategy. You will build a flexible game engine capable of handling various card types, abilities, and tournament mechanics.

## Given rules:
- Your code must be written in Python 3.10+
- Your code must respect the flake8 linter standards
- All exercises must be executed from the repository root (e.g., `python3 -m ex0.main`)
- Use absolute imports (e.g., `from ex0.Card import Card`)
- Use type hints for all function signatures and class methods
- Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes
- All processing should be done in-memory (no file I/O)
- Focus on demonstrating abstract programming patterns clearly
